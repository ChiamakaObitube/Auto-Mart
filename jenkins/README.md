# Jenkins Continuous Everything

## Overview

Jenkins is a self-contained, open-source automation server that can be used to automate all sorts of tasks related to building, testing, and delivering or deploying software. Jenkins is a highly extensible product whose functionality can be extended through the installation of plugins. It is a server-based system that runs in servlet containers such as Apache Tomcat. It runs on the Java ecosystem. Jenkins is useful if your goal is either continuous integration or continuous delivery. 

Its major contributors include GitHub, CloudBeers, JFrog, RedHat, AWS, Open Source Lab etc. Jenkins releases a new update weekly. The latest version is 2.292 while the LTS version is 2.277.4.

## Features

Jenkins can be installed on the following operating systems and platforms - Linux, Docker, Kubernetes, Windows, macOS, WAR files.

Jenkins can also be run on the cloud and many public cloud vendors provide their own Jenkins installation guides and packages.

GitHub Authentication is an example of how the security realm and authorization strategy works to control access to Jenkins.
